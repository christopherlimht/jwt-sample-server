# JWT API Server
This project is a sample JWT API server implemented by me using NodeJS, ExpressJS and the JWT library provided by JWT.io. JSON Web Tokens(JWTs) are an open, industry standard RFC 7519 method for representing claims securely between two parties.

Methods to generate and verify JWT tokens and a simple login system are exposed through the API. The simple login system serves as a short demo of the implementation of a basic login system using JWT. It is not meant to be used in production and is purely used for testing, learning and tinkering purposes.
